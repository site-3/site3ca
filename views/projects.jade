    h2 Super Street Fire
    p Super Street Fire is a simulated fighting game in the style of Street Fighter. However, instead of playing a traditional video game, the participants interact with the game with motions and thoughts; wearing interactive sensors for each fist, and an EEG headband.
    p Instead of an actual fight, the participants face off by controlling a two-dimensional wall of fire, creating flames of their own color to attack and defend.

    h2 Flux &amp; Fire
    p Imagine during the evening a lone Nuit Blanche wanderer catches a glimpse of dancing flames. The wanderer is drawn to the flames; for to be around fire is to be connected to an intimate place where humans have always gathered.
    p What could these flames be… a bonfire, a burning sculpture, a random act of vandalism?

    h2 Shannon's Fireflies
    p Alice, having walked up to the cube to inspect the fireflies closer, wonders how those on the edge of the cube would respond to her own lights. She takes out a small light on her keychain, and flashes it at one of the closest fireflies. The firefly lights up, which then wakes up its neighbors, and the stream of light passes through the cube to the other end.

    h2 Pyrokenisis
    p PK4A stands for “Pyrokinesis for Alex”, where Alex is the last person you’d ever want to have the ability to shoot fire with the power of her mind. Using a wireless EEG headset and a control unit connected to a flame effect, participants can create 20′+ blasts of fire with their thoughts.
