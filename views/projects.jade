        h2 Shannon's Fireflies
        p Alice, having walked up to the cube to inspect the fireflies closer, wonders how those on the edge of the cube would respond to her own lights. She takes out a small light on her keychain, and flashes it at one of the closest fireflies. The firefly lights up, which then wakes up its neighbors, and the stream of light passes through the cube to the other end.
