    h2 Laser Traning
    p This class will take you through the basics of good vector document preparation for any 2-dimensional CNC tool. It will cover the specific steps for using the laser, from creating an image in the proper format to correct and safe operation of the laser itself.
    p Participants will cut or etch their own class completion certificates, which we'll keep at Site 3 as the way to know who is allowed to use the laser, and will get to do a cut/etch job of their own design to take home.

    h2 3D Printing
    p This class covers the specifics of preparing a job for our 3D printer and will let you print a small job. It does not cover how to make 3D models. Follows the Laser Class, so you can have a full day of home manufacturing classes!

    h2 Getting Started with Arduino
    p This Wiring and Arduino workshop is directed at people wanting to learn about Wiring and Arduino, and how to program the boards to control things like lights, switches and motors.
    p Students will learn how to program using the software environment and go through a set of examples and demonstrations.

    h2 Basic Woodworking
    p  If you're afraid of any of the big, loud, finger-severing tools this is your chance to learn how to use them safely and make something practical at the same time. Your end goal is to create a lidded box with internal dimensions of 3" x 3" x 4" that you'll be able to cherish forever.
